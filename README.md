# üìö Programming Languages Major Final Work

Welcome to my repository showcasing the final work I completed for my Programming Languages major. This repository includes three main components, each highlighting different aspects of programming languages and paradigms.

## 1. [üêç Python Functional Programming Problems](/Functional/)

Explore a collection of Python programs that demonstrate functional programming concepts. These problems cover topics like higher-order functions, lambda expressions, map, filter, and more.

## 2. [üß† Prolog Logical Programming Problems](/Logical/)

Dive into logical programming with a set of Prolog programs. These problems illustrate logical reasoning, rule-based programming, and knowledge representation using Prolog.

## 3. [‚öΩ OOP python Soccer Management System](/OOP/)

Discover an object-oriented programming (OOP) project‚Äîa soccer management system built in Python. This comprehensive system includes features for team management, match scheduling, pand more.

## üöß Project Status

All components of this repository are completed and fully functional. Feel free to explore the solutions, learn from them, and use them to deepen your understanding of programming languages, functional programming, logical programming, and object-oriented programming.

## üìñ Purpose

This repository serves as a culmination of my studies in Programming Languages, showcasing my ability to work with a diverse set of programming paradigms. It's designed to assist students, developers, and enthusiasts in learning and applying these concepts in their own projects.
