# Logical Programming Problems in Python

This repository contains Python programs that solve various logical programming problems. Each Python file addresses a specific problem or set of problems. Below, you'll find descriptions and explanations for each problem along with their respective Python files.

## Q1 - Symmetric Difference of Lists

[q1.py](q1.py)

- Defines three lambda functions for list manipulation.
- `input_list` converts input into a list of integers.
- `contains` checks if an element is in a list.
- `simetric_dif` finds the symmetric difference between two lists using lambda functions.

## Q2 - Changing Elements in a List

[q2.py](q2.py)

- Defines two lambda functions.
- `input_list` converts input into a list of integers.
- `change_num` replaces elements in a list with a new value.
- Demonstrates how to call `change_num` with user input.

## Q3 - Palindromes in a String

[q3.py](q3.py)

- Checks if a given string contains a palindrome of a specified length.
- Uses lambda functions `is_palindrome` and `contains_palindrome`.
- Takes input for string and length, then prints "sim" if a palindrome is found, or "nao" if not.

## Q4 - Filtering Prime Numbers

[q4.py](q4.py)

- Filters prime numbers from a list of integers using a lambda function.
- `input_list` converts input into a list of integers.
- `is_primo` checks if a number is prime.
- Prints prime numbers from the input list.

## Q5 - Checking if a Point is Inside a Rectangle

[q5.py](q5.py)

- Defines a lambda function `is_inside` to check if a point is inside a rectangle.
- Takes input for the rectangle and point coordinates.
- Prints "True" if the point is inside the rectangle; otherwise, it prints "False."
